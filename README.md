# Real-Time-Drone-and-Aircraft-Detection-
Proposes a real-time drone detection model with deep learning models(YOLOv3). 
## Abstract
A drone monitoring system that integrates deep-learning-based detection and tracking modules is proposed in this work.
## Dataset
In this study, different models were trained on a dataset containing a total of 2664 images. The entire dataset was used for training. For the test process, drone videos collected from different sources from the internet were used.

For the test work, we used a public-domain drone dataset, USC Drone Dataset, which consists of 30 YouTube video sequences and captures different drone models with various appearances.
